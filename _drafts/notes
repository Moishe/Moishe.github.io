"talking to customers" outline

main points
===

generic tenet is "talk to our users"
chad says it, mikeg says it, everyone says it
and it's not just talk!
bernadette does a ton of work to help us meet users
adrienne does a ton of work to help us help users

even in eng

a basic piece of deploying features is using prototype groups
prototype groups have forums; sometimes engineers participate

we can also watch research sessions
read forums
etc

my goal though is to encourage everyone in this room to go much further

I always think about this SAT analogy: Etsy Sellers:Etsy Buyers::Etsy Admin:Etsy Users

but eng occupies a special place in that equation

this isn't to take away from anyone else's job, but rather to point out where eng could be doing qualitatively better than we are
other roles are arguably more directly involved with users *already* (sometimes because that's their explicit goal (seller dev, user research), sometimes because they've done work to make it happen (product))
but we're literally putting the bits together
the more we know about our users the better
maybe not directly -- maybe like me we're doing general infrastructure work --
but knowing "the work I do is going to impact <x> who I've talked to in person" is going to make you do a better job

talk about community eng team, what did we do

- captain's summits
- craft fairs
- craft party calendar

what happened

- first-name basis -- or even friends -- with some of our best sellers
- motivation
- profound sense of caring & responsibility
- team identity & esprit-du-corps "we're the ones who help team captains -- people like Karli -- make great teams"

maybe this was the wrong outcome?

- might've slowed down our velocity
  - more time talking less time coding
  - more time on foundations with assumption of long-term investment
- made getting reorged extremely difficult
  - betrayal
  - failure
  - "table with nothing on it"
  - what are the people who i'm friends with on facebook gonna think? we're abandoning them

i obviously don't think it was

- worth acknowledging risks

but here's the main thing

- i think sometimes we worry about our sellers overreacting to bad news
  - internal reputation of forums as being hive of discontent/complaining
  - our own preconceptions of sellers are hugely inaccurate (eg. Ele Willoughby)
- sometimes we treat our own employees the same way
- it's patronizing to shield people from bad news and not trust them to see big picture
- we were able to admit problems with planning/re-org and be very transparent and honest about it internally
- normalize change and it's less scary for everyone
- ^ transparency, ^ honesty, ^ trust => tighter bonds => better ideas, better feedback, users as evangelists

can we also strive for that with our users?
- think about things our competitors literally cannot do, and do those things extraordinarily well

am i a hypocrite?

- yeah probably

notes for talk

this is my story about how I talk to users
not a how to, not saying it's only or best, I'm sure there are people doing it better
but I want to talk about why I think it matters that we *do* talk to our users
not proscriptive, but descriptive

a little background, my mom: Etsy Seller?
assumption about who our sellers are

okay let's go

here's the basic arc:

- preface: I want to talk about talking to users, by focusing on my personal experience
- lots of people and lots of people IN THIS ROOM already do this and probably do better at it than I do!
- find your own path

- my mom/my home
  - growing up, surrounded by art, my mom almost obsessively making beautiful things
- walk into Etsy, feels like home
- huge part of taking job was thought about how different my childhood might've been if Etsy had existed
- so I sorta thought i knew our users
- then I went to Berlin
- whoa! whole other level. People running teams: true leadership, creativity, inventiveness
- maybe screenshot from designosaurYEAH
- lithuanian street team
- okay so
- tried to fold that into the community team
- some things we did:
