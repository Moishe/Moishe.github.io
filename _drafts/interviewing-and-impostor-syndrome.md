title: I Don't Know

As I've [mentioned before](/2015/12/16/lowering-the-bar/), my co-worker Tim & I teach an interview training class at Etsy. The 2nd most important thing we teach[^1] is the concept of "mapping the potato" -- discovering the boundary between what a candidate knows and doesn't know, along many many different vectors.

The idea of mapping a candidate's knowledge is completely dependent upon reaching a moment when the candidate says -- or implies -- "I don't know." Getting to that state is the only way you can discover those boundaries. 

I've always thought about this moment as the moment when the search space you're traveling along explodes in multiple different dimensions. What you're exploring changes from something like "show me your knowledge about how TCP works" to what can be summarized as "show me how you act when you don't know the answer to something." The latter is comprised of things like asking questions, applying knowledge about how computers work, communicating abstract and maybe not-fully-formed ideas, bouncing hypotheses around, dealing with ambiguity, probing for knowledge, and on and on -- all of these are objectively important skills and giving a candidate a space to show them is vital to hiring well. The rate at which you, as an interviewer, are gathering data increases geometrically at the "I don't know" moment.

But: I recently learned that my thoughts on the above lacked some depth.

This past weekend, I attended a weird conference[^2] with about 40 friends and friends-of-friends. We talked about all sorts of stuff, including a session on building diverse teams. Naturally, part of this conversation was about hiring (though let me take this moment to emphasize that hiring is a small part of building diverse teams).

During this session, [Marco Rogers](https://twitter.com/polotek) framed the "I don't know" moment in a way I'd never thought of before. 

In short, I hadn't thought in enough depth about my particular "white dude" privilege around the "I don't know" moment.

Growing up in the 80s, during the era of computer "whiz kids" it was incredibly easy for me to identify with people like Bill Gates and Nolan Bushnell and Steve Wozniak and Bill Atkinson in no small part because they looked like slightly modified, older versions of me. Beyond that, I was told explicitly and implicitly -- by living in a rich suburban town, and having family members who were nerdy and smart and academic, and watching movies like Real Genius that were full of nerds who looked like slightly older versions of me -- that it was safe to be a little rebellious and a little weird and that even not knowing things or being selectively lazy was a form of social cachet.

Because of that, when I was personally confronted with moments as a candidate where I didn't know the answer to something, it came naturally to me to admit that and start dissecting a problem. Don't get me wrong -- it was fucking terrifying to do this. Indeed, just last week I was the candidate in a mock interview as part of a class, and I knew the question I'd be asked, and I'm friends with the guy who was mock-interviewing me, and I even had a good sense of how I could guide the the interview down a path where the stuff-I-didn't-know was relatively unthreatening, and I was still moderately terrified beforehand and a little shaky and had a little flop-sweat going on.

But: in the mock interview, I _knew_ I wouldn't be fired. And in every _real_ interview I've ever done, I've always known I had a safety net of _n_ other tech companies who would probably hire me. And even more than that: I knew, because _everyone told me so_ that I _did_ know what was up with computers. I magically get the privilege of having internalized "people who look like me are allowed to fail, so failing-to-know-the-answer isn't the same as failing-the-interview." I don't have to struggle against growing up with people telling me I'm the "other" and I don't have to struggle against whatever unconscious biases the interviewer has; indeed, the interviewer's unconscious biases almost certainly unfairly help me. So the worst "I don't know" moment I've ever experienced is qualitatively different for me than it is for somebody who's grown up without the giant scaffolding that I get propped up by.

I had never imagined, really, what it might be like to grow up in a situation where your ability to be good at writing computer programs would be doubted because of how you looked and/or where you lived. I'd never thought how it might feel, when those doubts are constant and implicit, to say "I don't know."

I can't really imagine that, but the best I can do is accept that it is a real thing that affects a lot of really smart people; people who look different than me -- people of different races, different genders. This self-doubt that comes from a constant pervasive societal doubt affects many people in ways I will never be privy to. Many of the people affected by this crap are very likely people I'd love to work with. I want to actively fight to make sure I can work with them!

So, what can _I_ as an interviewer do to ameliorate this?

The best thing I can think of -- and I, again, must give credit to Tim for this strategy -- is to be very explicit with the candidate that the whole _point_ of the interview is to get to an "I don't know" moment. In Tim's words, "just cheat! Short circuit the whole thing!" Emphasize that -- in this room, in this tiny little artificial thing you're constructing with the candidate -- saying "I don't know, but I think ..." is _success_, not failure. I can repeat that at every opportunity, and I can admit when _I_ don't know something. My role in the interview is not to pounce on the candidate's failures; my role is to give them a chance to show off their strengths -- I need to make sure they know this.

Maybe the above paragraph is best summarized as "_I_ don't know." I can try to constantly remind myself of that -- not in a constrained, let me figure out this computer-program kind of way -- but in a way that admits my own blind spots and admits to things that make _me_ uncomfortable. I'm incredibly thankful I was able to sit in a room with people who are thoughtful and caring enough to clue me in to things to which I would otherwise be blind.

[^1]: The first -- what Tim calls the "Prime Directive" -- is "respect the candidate."
[^2]: I refuse to call it an "unconference" though I will admit that is probably the best word for it
