As I've [mentioned before](/2015/12/16/lowering-the-bar/), my co-worker Tim & I teach an interview training class at Etsy. One of the key things we teach is the idea of "mapping the potato" -- discovering the boundary between what a candidate and knows and doesn't know, along many many different vectors.

The idea of mapping a candidate's knowledge literally doesn't work with reaching a moment when the candidate says -- or implies -- "I don't know." Getting to that state is the only way you can discover those boundaries. 

I've always thought about this moment as the moment when the "search space" you're traveling along explodes in multiple different dimensions. What you're exploring changes from something like "show me your knowledge about how TCP works" to what can be summarized as "show me how you act when you don't know the answer to something." The latter is comprised of things like asking questions, applying knowledge about how computers work, communicating abstract and maybe not-fully-formed ideas, bouncing hypotheses around, dealing with ambiguity, probing for knowledge, and on and on -- all of these are objectively important skills and giving a candidate a space to show them is vital to hiring well. The rate at which you, as an interviewer, are gathering data increases geometrically at the "I don't know" moment.

But: I recently learned that my thoughts on the above were more brittle than I thought they were.

This past weekend, I attended a weird conference[^1] with about 40 friends and friends-of-friends. We talked about all sorts of stuff, but yesterday we had a session on building diverse teams. Naturally, part of this conversation was about hiring (though let me reiterate that hiring is a small part of building diverse teams).

During this session, [Marco Rogers](https://twitter.com/polotek) framed the "I don't know" moment in a way I'd never thought of before. 

I hadn't thought in enough depth about my particular priviledge around this issue.

Growing up in the 80s, during the era of computer "whiz kids" it was so incredibly easy for me to identify with people like Bill Gates and Nolan Bushnell and Steve Wozniak and Bill Atkinson in no small part because they looked like slightly modified, older versions of me. Beyond that, I was told explicitly and implicitly -- by living in a rich suburban town, and having family members who were nerdy and smart and academic, and watching movies like Real Genius that were full of nerds who looked like older versions of me -- that it was safe to be a little rebellious and a little weird and that even not knowing things or being selectively lazy was a form of social cachet.

I had never imagined, really, what it might be like to grow up in a situation where your ability 

Don't get me wrong -- the "I don't know" moment is terrifying for _everyone_. I did a mock interview last week as part of an interview training class, and I knew the question, and I'm friends with the guy who was mock-interviewing me, and I even had a good sense of how I could guide the the interview down a path where the stuff-I-didn't-know was relatively unthreatening, and I was still moderately terrified beforehand and a little shaky and had a tiny flop-sweat going on.

But even in an interview situation with a job on the line, I still get that privilege of having internalized "people who look like me are allowed to fail, so failing-to-know-the-answer isn't the same as failing-the-interview." I don't have to struggle against growing up with people telling me I'm the "other" and I don't have to struggle against whatever unconscious biases the interviewer has; indeed, the interviewer's unconscious biases almost certainly unfairly help me. So the worst "I don't know" moment I've ever experienced is qualitatively different for me than it is for somebody who's grown up without the giant scaffolding that I get propped up by.

So, what can we as interviewers do to ameliorate this?

The best thing I can think of -- and I would love to hear other people's strategies -- is being very explicit with the candidate that the whole point of the interview is to get to an "I don't know" moment. Emphasize that -- in this room, in this tiny little artificial thing you're constructing with the candidate -- saying "I don't know, but I think ..." is _success_, not failure. Say that repeatedly, and also admit when _you_ don't know something.

Also, and just as importantly, check yourself and check your attitudes constantly. What are you assuming about the candidate that you haven't seen?
