Despite being a nerd, I was never all that into reading science fiction and fantasy when I was growing up. I tried _so hard_ to like Asimov and Tolkien -- I considered liking them kind of a ticket to entry into the world of people who liked other things I like -- but I don't think I ever finished a single book by either of them.

When I finally read _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. LeGuin, I felt like I'd finally found the literary changed what I thought not only SF could be but really what _books_ could be.

In the [introduction to that book](http://theliterarylink.com/leguinintro.html), LeGuin says something that I've never forgotten:

>The artist deals with what cannot be said in words. 
>
>The artist whose medium is fiction does this in words. 
>The novelist says in words what cannot be said in words.
