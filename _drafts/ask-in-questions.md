Despite being a nerd, I was never all that into reading science fiction and fantasy when I was growing up. I tried _so hard_ to like Asimov and Tolkien -- I considered liking them kind of a ticket to entry into the world of people who liked other things I like -- but I don't think I ever finished a single book by either of them.

When I finally read _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. LeGuin, it changed what I thought not only SF could be but really what _books_ could be.

In the [introduction to that book](http://theliterarylink.com/leguinintro.html), LeGuin says something that I've never forgotten:

>The artist deals with what cannot be said in words. 
>The artist whose medium is fiction does this in words. The novelist says in words what cannot be said in words. 

I found that idea revelatory. It's an elegant expression of, maybe, what literary criticism and to some degree history and every other liberal art _is_ -- the subtle art of uncovering things that can't be spoken of directly; the oblique approach when the direct one fails not despite but because of its directness.

A few years after I started being pretty actively involved in interviewing at Google, I realized that deriving answers to unasked questions is at the heart of what great interviewers do. I also realized that questions that are anything _other_ than surface-level starting places -- lights to cast shadows on the cave wall, if you will -- are classic examples of bad interview questions.

Imagine you are in an interview ehere every questions you ask would be answered with perfect fidelity. What kind of questions would you ask? _Are_ the answers you'd want even answers to ask-able questions? I assert that what you want is of qualitatively un-askable, and can only be observed obliquely.

For instance, something I look for in co-workers is, well, whether they _know how a computer works_. So in my imaginary full-fidelity, absolute-honesty world, maybe I could ask a candidate "hey candidate, do you know how a computer works?" and perform a magical shortcut. But what would the answer be? If "yes," what does that mean? Does it mean you could give a formal proof of Turing-completeness for an arbitrary machine? Does it mean you could explain how a modern processor works in perfect detail?
