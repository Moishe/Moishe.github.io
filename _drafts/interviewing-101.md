title: Interviewing 101

Every quarter or so, Tim Falzone and I teach an "Interviewing 101" class at Etsy. This post is an attempt to write up some of the points we cover during that class. A thing I like about the class as we teach it is that it is explicitly _not_ about interview specific questions; it's about the _other_ things you should know before your first time walking into a room to interview a candidate.

At Etsy we embrace a culture of blamelessness -- if you make a mistake, we see that as a chance for everyone to learn. We advocate a similar approach to interviewing: nobody's good at it without practicing, so we try to design systems so that allow for iteration, refinement, and constant learning.

Prime directive: Candidate happiness

Okay, so after saying all those nice things about learning and mistakes being okay, I have to get the one thing out of the way that is _not_ subject to that philosophy: candidate happiness. Except for occasional outliers, every candidate should leave an interview at Etsy feeling like they were treated with respect and that they were given the chance to showcase their strengths.

There are few reasons for this. The first is, well, basic human decency. As an interviewer, you're in a position of power. Your actions are amplified in the eyes of the candidate, so you need to take special care to think about the candidate's position. 

TODO some hints about this

Why interview?

TODO like why not do a standardized test? Why not let HR do it?

Show don't tell

TODO amazingly we have a framework for this in technical interviewing.

Get to "I don't know"

TODO this is when shit gets awesome. BUT REMEMBER THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.

Random things

TODO questions not to ask: protected stuff, see [xxx] for details.
TODO don't answer "how did I do?"

The goals, redux
