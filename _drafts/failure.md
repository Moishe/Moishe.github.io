(_this is adopted from part of my Last Lecture at Etsy_)

I want to take about failure.

More specifically, I want to talk about succeeding at failure and failing at failure.

Until about a week and a half ago, I worked at Etsy. Working there was amazing, and I feel confident saying I learned more in three years there about what it means to be an engineer and what it means to be a human being in a complex organization than I did in my previous twenty years in the software industry.

A cornerstone of Etsy's culture is a philosophy of "blamelessness". This is the idea that, when things go wrong, it's not due to malice or incompetence on any individual's part, but because of the interactions of many pieces of a very complex system. When things do go wrong, it's an opportunity to look at the system as a whole and see how to improve _the system_, not the individuals who acted rationally within that system.

At the heart of this is the generous and humane idea that people act rationally and that they do things that appear correct at the time. This mindset leads to many, many great outcomes; the best, for me, was the immediate and powerful sense of support I felt from my community of co-workers when things went wrong.

When I'd been at Etsy for a couple of months, I started work on a project which tells sellers when their listings start getting unexpectedly high traffic. Before Etsy, I'd been at Google for many years, and because of that I approached this problem in a very Google way. 

About 8 weeks later, I'd gone quite a ways down the path of implementing this project in a very Google way, and was close to actually shipping it. Then our CTO found out about how I'd implemented it, and asked to meet with my manager & I about it.
