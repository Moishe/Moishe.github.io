Today I want to talk about something I've always called "gut feel" but my grand-manager Lara refers to much more eloquently as "spidey-sense," and how listening to it matters during interviews.

Many years ago, when I was new to interviewing, I conducted a lunch interview at Google in Kirkland. You know when things go weird, you remember all sorts of tiny details? I remember that this was in the *old* Google Kirkland, up higher on the hill, when the cafe was smaller, and when it was easy to hear people playing foosball in the game room. It was a day when we could see the Olympic mountains in all their glory from the cafe. I remember the desserts that were out on the special dessert table -- some sort of pie with lots of whipped cream.

I also remember standing in line with the guy I was interviewing, seeing him look around, and hearing him remark, "wow, there are a lot of HOT girls here, huh?"

I am still ashamed about this: I quietly agreed.
