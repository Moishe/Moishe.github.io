Many years ago, when I was new to interviewing, I did a lunch interview at Google in Kirkland with a guy I'll call Andrew.

You know when things go weird, you remember all sorts of tiny details? I remember that this was in the *old* Google Kirkland, up higher on the hill, when the cafe was smaller, and when it was easy to hear people playing foosball in the game room. It was a day when we could see the Olympic mountains in all their glory from the cafe. I remember the desserts that were out on the special dessert table -- some sort of pie with lots of whipped cream.

I also remember standing in line with Andrew-not-his-real-name, watching him look around, and hearing him say, "wow, there are a lot of HOT girls here, huh?"

I was a little uncomfortable with that statement -- and probably many of the women I worked with would've been WAY more uncomfortable with it -- but I've never mentioned it until writing this post. I certainly never mentioned it to anyone involved in making a hiring decision about him. I don't know if Andrew-not-his-real-name got hired or not, but I have a bad feeling he did, and I worry about what effect that might've had on his co-workers, especially his co-workers who were women.

A few years after that, I had an interview scheduled with a very senior engineer, who I'll call Richard. This was a guy whose name was the first result when you Googled "who invented $SOME_IMPRESSIVE_TECH" and I walked in expecting a pretty fun interview. The stuff he worked on had neat overlap with one of my favorite interview questions, and his resum√© was super impressive, and I was on a streak of learning cool things from people smarter than me during interviews. Unfortunately, from the minute I walked in the door it was obvious Richard-not-his-real-name was emphatically _not_ looking forward to our interview, and the more we talked the more obvious that became. I eventually switched to a mode of "I will be completely deferential now and let this guy be the asshole pedant he so clearly wants to be" which made the rest of the interview easier for both of us. When I wrote feedback I made the nature of our interaction abundantly clear: he did a great job technically, but he was an asshole about it.

I was in the hiring committee that reviewed Richard-not-his-real-name's packet. I was the only one on the loop who mentioned an interaction like this -- most of the rest of the feedback was fairly positive -- and I was nervous about being an outlier. When we started discussing his packet, though, Steve (maybe his real name, a super well-respected engineer and a guy who I really looked up to) said, "Oh. THIS guy! I worked with him at $COMPANY and he had a reputation as a complete asshole; in particular he was known for playing politics but doing it badly." Obviously, at that point, the only choice was to not make him an offer.

I want to talk about the differences between these two scenarios, and I want to talk about why I think the first one is, regrettably, more common.

When I conducted the interview with Richard, I was already a seasoned interview.


So I should take a step back and talk a little about about lunch interviews at Google. When I taught interview training classes there, I recommended always starting out a lunch interview by telling the candidate "this is your time to re-charge for the afternoon: I'm here to help you out; I can answer questions or just talk about what it's like to work here or whatever, but I won't be submitting any feedback about what we talk about." And this is all 100% true: if you were a lunch interviewer at Google, the usual mechanism for submitting feedback about a candidate wasn't even _provided_ to you. Hiring committee didn't see feedback from lunch interviewers. And generally this is a good thing. We as interviewers should do everything we can to let candidates show themselves at their best, so it's important to give them a break, let them eat, let them not answer questions if they don't want to, etc.

In some ways, the lunch interview is meant to provide a place where it's okay for candidates to let their guard down a little bit.

So I was in a position where the candidate said something to me that made me kind of uncomfortable (and would doubtless have made many of the women in the office far more uncomfortable). When things that are a little weird or off happen to me, my default is to say nothing about them. In this case, that
