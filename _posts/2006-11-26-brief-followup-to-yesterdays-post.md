title: Brief followup to yesterday's post

---
Whew. I, um, seem to have struck a nerve.  
  
Some things which were implicit in yesterday's post but I should make explicit: I didn't work with any morons; indeed, everyone I worked with was extremely smart. The problems I saw weren't because of any incompetence on the micro scale or even anything attributable to just one person; the slowness and indecision were emergent properties of the system.  
  
Further, as massive as Vista is, it's still just a small piece of Microsoft. One thing which always impressed me about Microsoft was how each team truly did have its own personality and distinct development style. I worked on teams which used Scrum, teams which were small enough to subscribe to no development process at all, and teams which made medium-scale development work very efficiently. I think and hope that my particular nook in Vista was a pathological case which makes for good illustration but whose faults were particularly exaggerated and obvious.  
  
Finally, people have asked what's different at Google. I refer you to [my esteemed colleague from the 4th floor](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html) for a treatment which is surely better written and more engaging than anything I can say.
