title: Portraits for Donations

This is for people in Boulder (or, I guess, people willing to travel to Boulder)

I've been feeling a little powerless re: our president. Obviously, I want to fight against the things he's doing and the things he's planning to do, and I've been trying to think of healthy & productive ways to do that.

So here's a first step: I love taking photographs, and I want to get better at taking portraits. So, I'd like to trade portraits (of humans or pets!) for donations to organizations that are fighting against the regressive policies our president is enacting, or your own time spent fighting those policies.

I'll get a chance to take portraits, which I love doing, and you'll get a portrait of yourself (or your pet, or another human, if you want!). We'll all have contributed money or time towards helping ameliorate the bad things our president wants to do.

Your participation in this part is optional: if you opt in, I'll add your portrait to a collection on a single site, with aggregate data about how much money and time we donated, and to which organizations. I'll also publish the portraits (again, if you opt in) one at a time to Instagram, along with a brief interview of the subject (or the subject's proxy, in the case of pets!).

I want to foster a sense of community -- we're all in this together, and we're all interesting human beings with stories to tell and reasons to resist.

Here's how it'll work:

   - donate to a non-profit that's helping refugees, or public education, or civil rights, or any of the other many, many causes that are going to need help over the coming years. (some suggestions are below)
   - *OR* donate your time! If you've called your senators, or if you've attended marches, or done anything else that feels substantial, that works too! The point is being part of resisting; however you do that, you qualify.
   - there's no minimum donation amount, or time amount. I trust you to do what you can.
   - show me a picture of your donation receipt, with a date of 2/8 or later. If you didn't donate, tell me how much time you've spent. This will be used to aggregate stats for the project as a whole.
   - we'll set up a time to do a portrait session at my office/ad-hoc studio up in North Boulder. It'll probably take about 30-45 minutes. Weekends are best but if your schedule is tight, we can work something out.
   - I'll give you a fully-edited, print-ready file, and recommendations for places to get a high-quality print.
	- *if you're in the first 15 people to get in touch, I'll give you a 8x10 black and white print of your portrait, printed on Ilford Galerie RC paper by Digital Silver Imaging (http://www.digitalsilverimaging.com/).*
Here's some of my better photography, with examples of human & dog portraits: http://moishe-lettvin.format.com/

As a starting point, here's a kind-of random list of some charities I recommend:

[ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/)

[CODE 2040](https://www.code2040.org/)

[International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/)

[International Refugee Assistance Project](https://refugeerights.org/)

[The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/)

[Natural Resource Defense Council](https://nrdc.org)

[Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/)

[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/)

Feel free to share this widely; I'm happy to make portraits of strangers (or their pets) too!
