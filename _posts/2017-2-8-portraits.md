This is for people in Boulder (or, I guess, people willing to travel to Boulder)

I've been feeling a little powerless re: our president. Obviously, I want to fight against the things he's doing and the things he's planning to do, and I've been trying to think of healthy & productive ways to do that.

So here's a first step: I love taking photographs, and I want to get better at taking portraits. So, I'd like to trade portraits (of humans or pets!) for donations to organizations that are fighting against the regressive policies our president is enacting.

Here's how it'll work:

   - donate to a non-profit that's helping refugees, or public education, or civil rights, or any of the other many, many causes that are going to need help over the coming years. (some suggestions are below)
   - there's no minimum donation amount. I trust you to donate what you think is appropriate. For context, "headshot" portraits typically cost between $100-$500
   - show me a picture of your donation receipt, with a date of 2/8 or later
   - we'll set up a time to do a portrait session at my office/ad-hoc studio up in North Boulder. It'll probably take about 30-45 minutes. Weekends are best but if your schedule is tight, we can work something out.
   - I'll give you a fully-edited, print-ready file, and recommendations for places to get a high-quality print.

I'd like to collect all the portraits and some quotes about what charity you donated to, and why. I'll publish these one at a time on Instagram/Facebook, and collect them all into a website (and perhaps a printed collection). That portfolio or website will have a total of *all* donations but won't show individual's donation amount. Participation in this part is optional -- if you'd prefer your participation to be private, that is understandable and okay (but I would like to include your donation amount in the project page).

Here's some of my better photography, with examples of human & dog portraits: http://moishe-lettvin.format.com/

As a starting point, here's a kind-of random list of some charities I recommend:

[ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/)
[CODE 2040](http://www.code2040.org/)
[The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/)
[International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/)
[International Refugee Assistance Project](https://refugeerights.org/)
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/)

Feel free to share this widely; I'm happy to make portraits of strangers (or their pets) too!
