title: George Dyson on Skynet... er, Google

>   
For 30 years I have been wondering, what indication of its existence might we expect from a true AI? Certainly not any explicit revelation, which might spark a movement to pull the plug. Anomalous accumulation or creation of wealth might be a sign, or an unquenchable thirst for raw information, storage space, and processing cycles, or a concerted attempt to secure an uninterrupted, autonomous power supply. But the real sign, I suspect, would be a circle of cheerful, contented, intellectually and physically well-nourished people surrounding the AI. There wouldn't be any need for True Believers, or the downloading of human brains or anything sinister like that: just a gradual, gentle, pervasive and mutually beneficial contact between us and a growing something else. This remains a non-testable hypothesis, for now. The best description comes from science fiction writer Simon Ings:  
  
"When our machines overtook us, too complex and efficient for us to control, they did it so fast and so smoothly and so usefully, only a fool or a prophet would have dared complain."  


  
  
Here's a [link](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dyson05/dyson05_index.html) to the article itself.  
  
I do think there's a sea change coming in how computers interact with data, but I also think we're many years away from any AI which would pass a Turing test. Whether that's a yardstick for intelligence, I don't know, but I don't think that -- even at the massive levels of interconnection now available -- we're anywhere close to the levels of complexity necessary to model an even moderately complicated biological organism.  
  
I don't see the bridge between "Google's AI is, at a high level, not a Von Neumann machine" and "Google's AI is anywhere close to possessing -- or enabling something else to possess -- volition and consciousness".
