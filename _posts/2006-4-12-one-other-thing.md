title: One other thing

Somebody asked, in reference to my earlier [post about interviewing](http://www.drizzle.com/~lettvin/2005/12/programming-interviews-sort-of-exposed.html), if I could recommend any good books on the subject.  
  
[I can](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html). Or perhaps you'd enjoy [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0673386023/002-8116974-0532023?v=glance&n=283155).  
  
Seriously, no book specifically about interviewing will do a good job preparing you for a well-conducted technical interview. Reams of programming experience and smarts will help, and sometimes even that's not enough.  
  
That said, you can check [Gayle's interviewing page](http://www.glaak.com/interviews/) and Steve Yegge's [blog](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/), specifically some of his interviewing [ponderings](http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/practical-magic.html).
