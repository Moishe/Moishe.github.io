title: New job\!

---
I started my [new job](http://toolbar.msn.com/) today. Way way way more coding-intensive that my previous job; moving from Longhorn to MSN feels like a jump back in msft-time about 10 years in many ways, mostly good. I just wish the stock would start acting like it did 10 years ago...  
  
Anyway, got to dive right in today fixing relevant bugs and learning the guts of the indexer. It's freakin' cool. I'm so amped to get my hands dirty in the code so soon.  
  
No riding the past couple of days but I'll go out tomorrow morning before work for a nice spin. I'm curious to see how I feel after the 200; I actually haven't felt tired at all but my hands are bugging me in a way similar to how my feet hurt me back on the AT -- weird tingliness & swelling & redness in the palms. Maybe I need to raise the handlebars on my Axis or just run a bigger, softer front tire. I haven't ever had this happen after long mountain bike rides. In happier news, though, my feet are just fine.  
  
Gorgeous day here on the lake. I worked from home this afternoon and it was such a treat to look out the window over the lake at the newly-snow-covered mountains. No eagle sightings today, but lots of ducks & jumping fish.
