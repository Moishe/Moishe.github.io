Robert Cringely has an interesting article talking in which he says,

What Google WILL do is roll-out incremental products at a blinding pace. Not long ago, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin explained to me that rapid development is an important key to market dominance.  
  
"What you want to do," he said, "is listen to your customers and bring out every two weeks improved versions that would each take your competitor two months to complete. That's when you are on a rocket -- they can't keep up so they can't compete. They lose hope and pretty soon you have the market pretty much to yourself."  
  
That pace of technical development, which probably isn't sustainable for long at any company, isn't POSSIBLE at all at more mature companies like AOL, Yahoo, and especially Microsoft. That adolescent energy is the mojo that makes a startup scarier to Bill Gates than a mature competitor. He knows that if Microsoft ever takes a big dive, it will be because of a Google, not a Yahoo, and certainly not an AOL.  


  
The thing is, Microsoft _could_ roll out advances in all sorts of products every two weeks. It's not sustainable company-wide but I don't see why individual product groups couldn't get on the train to do that sort of thing. I've seen that energy all over the place at MSN and I really think it could take hold in other product groups as well -- what it takes is a ship vehicle that's flexible enough \(web release, windows update\), and a team that's small enough, and most importantly a willingness to target the 90% case rather than the 100% case.  
  
The last is hard at Microsoft -- it's [this](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/10/28/53298.aspxa) that causes much \(not all, obviously\) of our release cycle lag. On Desktop Search, we released international versions post-facto which required going back and tinkering with our code after we released. Overall, it was more work. It was worth it though, we got a release out the door, generated buzz, and allowed a bunch of people to use our software. We sacrificed the 100% case to keep momentum and keep our team lean and focused. Again, the magic thing about software is the ease with which it can be modified. Building software is not like building bridges or cars; slop can be built in and used as necessary.
