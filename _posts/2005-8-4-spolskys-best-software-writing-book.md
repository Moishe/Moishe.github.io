I just got [The Best Software Writing I](http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html) edited by [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/index.html). Mostly I've just skimmed through it so far, but I did read [Adam Bosworth](http://www.adambosworth.net/)'s [ISCOC04 Talk](http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html).  
  
In it, he talks about the "organic" model of software development exemplified by \(among other things\) RSS, HTML and programming languages like PHP and Perl.  
  
This got me all fired up about search, and how we can capitalize and leverage organic tech. One thing that gets me very psyched about msft vs. google is this: [RSS search resuls](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=moishe%20lettvin&format=rss). MSN Search has them. Google doesn't. This is a very powerful tool -- it's great to subscribe to a query in your newsreader and see when new items are crawled. Yes, Google lets you subscribe to search results via email \(and also lets you subscribe to your gmail account, so you can end-run and get the same thing\), but the straight-up RSS query isn't allowed.  
  
What this is leading up to, I think, is a change in what RSS "means". Currently it's mostly about grabbing a static \(in that it's the same for every client\) list of articles. But RSS can be far more dynamic without betraying its simplicity; simply adding a 'query' parameter adds tremendous power. I'm curious to see how much further this can go.  
  
Another sweet MSN use of RSS: [Start](http://www.start.com/myw3b). Unfortunately this doesn't work on Safari, but it will work in Firefox and \(obviously\) IE.  
  
I think if MSN wasn't trying to overcome Microsoft's historical image problems \(and maybe some MSN-centric image problems around design & ads\), people would be jumping all over it as "more Google than Google." There are huge cultural shifts underway over here in RedWest.
