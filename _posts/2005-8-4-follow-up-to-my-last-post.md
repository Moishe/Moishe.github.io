OK, here's the thing: the magic of software is how fast you can write it, publish it and change it.  
  
Technology which increases the frequency, fidelity and simplicity of this cycle -- whether you think of it as the code/compile/test/debug cycle, or the code/release/modify cycle, or the write/comment/follow-up cycle -- is what leads to sea changes in how people think of and use technology. Gutenberg's press. The Apple \]\[. Turbo Pascal. HTML. RSS. The important thing is that all of the tech exposed by these is easily grasped by people of average intelligence. When you develop the Next Big Thing but it requires a PhD and 10 years of concentrated study to write "Hello World," re-think it. What's the easiest way to get your bits from your brain to the user's brain? What's the easiest way to let people use your nifty way of doing things?  
  
Organic and simple doesn't necessarily imply ugly, but the best solutions along most axes may in fact be ugly. Elegance doesn't imply utility.  
  
Bacteria comprise the most succesful phylum largely because of their extremely fast code/compile/test/debug cycle.
