title: Technical Interview Workshop Links

---
I'm giving a talk/workshop about how to prepare for the sorts of interviews we conduct here at Google for engineers. Here's a list of links to outside resources that may be valuable if you're thinking of interviewing at Google, Microsoft, Amazon or other tech companies that ask coding questions.   
  
[Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) has a couple of excellent posts, one of which I mostly cribbed to put my presentation together:   


  * [Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)
  * [Truth about interviewing](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/truth-about-interviewing.html)
MIT has course notes for [the course from which I stole the title of my talk](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php).   
  
I wrote [a fairly detailed breakdown of one of my favorite questions.](http://moishelettvin.blogspot.com/2005/12/programming-interviews-sort-of-exposed.html)  
  
Please add more links in the comments.
