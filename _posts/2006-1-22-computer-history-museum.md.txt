Yesterday morning I had a few hours to kill before going to the airport. First, I went to Google to play on a Linux box for a while \(amazing what a pleasant campus will do for employee productivity\) and then I headed to the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/).  
  
The museum is right down the street from both Google and Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus, so I had seen it a few times but never had a chance to go inside. I'm _so_ glad I finally made time for it: it was geek heaven in there\! They had a bank of vacuum tubes from ENIAC, they had the entire Johnniac \(a computer used for defense and named after John Von Neumann, who was incidentally an unwilling namesake\), [Google's First Server Cluster](http://www.vzwpix.com:80/mi/63786547_197394399_0.jpeg?limitsize=520,520&outquality=56&ext=.jpg&border=2,0,0,0) \(sorry for the crappy picture quality, my phone sucks\), three \(\!\) Cray computers, including a 90KW, 15 GFLOP, 2GB beauty from 1993.  
  
In addition: the Apple 1, in a plywood case, signed by Woz. A Tandy CoCo, which brought back some memories. A NeXT cube, an Enigma, a PDP-8, and a PDP-11. Also: another [massive DoD machine](http://www.vzwpix.com:80/mi/63784246_197386812_0.jpeg?limitsize=520,520&outquality=56&ext=.jpg&border=2,0,0,0), complete with built-in ashtrays.  
  
It was incredibly cool to see all this history aggregated in one place. Seeing machines I'd used in the context of their contemporaries and their predecessors was totally inspiring. It was a great way to end my week of Google-training.
