I've been at RedWest, one of Microsoft's satellite campi, for a week now. It's different over here.  
  
The first time I ever visited Microsoft, back in 1993, I ate lunch at the Building 9 cafeteria, right next to Lake Bill. I remember being surrounded by geeks -- but, somehow, cool geeks -- talking/arguing about coding problems, or design problems, or user interface. I was so jealous\! I wanted to be one of those geeks, geekin' out at lunch, getting psyched to go back to my office and wizard up some slick new Windows 3.1-based app. When I started at Microsoft, in '94, I got all that and more -- I got to work on Outlook, which was being built against then-unreleased Chicago \(Windows '95\) and NT4. I was surrounded by very smart people who were really excited about their jobs -- not necessarily something that's ALL good but pretty fun nonetheless.  
  
Since returning to Microsoft back in '03, that feeling has been largely missing. Yeah, people are excited about Longhorn, but it's such a massive project with such a massive amount of attendant process that the buzz/spark/whatever-you-want-to-call-it is damped down quite a bit. That's appropriate for a mature operating system, I think, but I really missed the spontaneity and excitement of those early days.  
  
So now it's like I've stepped through some weird wormhole into the Microsoft of '95. \(except the towels in the locker rooms didn't come back, and the stock isn't really doing what it used to\) But that fire is there -- everyone is amped about what they're doing and think \(hopefully correctly\) that the code they're writing RIGHT NOW really will change the world. I wish [MarkL](http://mark-lucovsky.blogspot.com/) \(not to mention our stockholders\) had a chance to come over and see what the search team is doing. We haven't forgotten how to ship, after all.
