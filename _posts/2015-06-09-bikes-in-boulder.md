title: Bikes in Boulder

---

Currently Boulder is debating "right-sizing" some roads to add bigger bike lanes, a center turn lane, and removing a travel lane in each direction. Needless to say this is contentious; below is the letter I wrote to City Council about it:

--------

>I'm writing to support the experiments to right-size streets
>here in Boulder, to allow safer bicycle and car traffic.
>
>I've only lived in Boulder for 4 years. The primary reason my wife,
>daughter and I moved here was Boulder's reputation as a place where we
>could live car-free. We haven't reached that ideal but during the
>summer time, we almost never drive. It's amazing and freeing! Our
>daughter's experienced all sorts of things she'd never see from a car
>-- seeing coyotes stalking prairie dogs, fast-moving storms, splashing
>through puddles, the sudden drop in temperature as the sun goes down,
>the joy of arriving at a restaurant a little bit sweaty and very
>hungry, etc. Every trip we take by bike is a mini adventure, and it is
>truly magical.
>
>Unfortunately, even in the short time we've lived here, I've seen
>traffic become increasingly heavy, with faster traffic, less attentive
>drivers, and more and more close calls. We live on 26th and Pine, and
>I work from home, and I hear or see at least one near-miss per day out
>my window; I don't ride on Folsom because the auto traffic is so
>heavy.
>
>I would love to see an experiment to make auto traffic a little less
>terrifying (from a bike or a car!), and make riding a bike feel much
>safer. Previous experiments in Seattle (where we used to live) have
>been very successful, and I would love it if Boulder surpassed their
>success.
>
>Thanks very much for your time, and I look forward to riding on Folsom
>with my daughter!
